Inspired by [OpenGlass](https://github.com/BasedHardware/openglass).

# Progress

## Prepare

Get the same hardware "ESP32 Sense", try to assemble it. âœ… `Hardware` `2024.5`

## Design

Get the same hardware, then discuss about the functions:

- **Understanding your pet better:** We record your pet's behaviors and analyze them using advanced multi-model LLM technology. This allows us to summarize your pet's preferences and provide feedback on any abnormal behavior. As a result, our app can be a tool to bridge the communication gap between you and your pet.

- **Automated journal:** (WIP) See [README.md](./README.md)

- **The fantastical voyage of rubber duck:** We put our machine inside a rubber duck, complete with extra driver module. Users can subscribe the travel diary of the duck. On his channel, this adventurous duck will be a brave and passionate traveler, ready to explore the world with boundless enthusiasm.

- **The DashCam that eliminates loneliness:** Just like Jarvis, it can interact with you while you drive, offering navigation, suggestions, and entertainment. Besides, it can recommend songs that perfectly match the current environment. While traveling, it helps you capture exciting moments, with the option to export them into a travel Vlog with a custom-made BGM produced by LM.
